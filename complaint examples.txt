        "I was charged a $30 overdraft fee on my account despite having enough funds. It took me three calls to customer service to get the fee reversed. This is a common issue with this bank, and the process is unnecessarily difficult.",
        "My credit card was used for fraudulent purchases totaling over $500. I reported the activity immediately, but the bank's fraud department was slow to respond. I had to wait weeks for a replacement card.",
        "I tried to send a money transfer to a friend, but the transaction failed. The app gave a vague error message. Customer support was not helpful and could not provide a reason for the failure. The funds were held for several days before being returned.",
