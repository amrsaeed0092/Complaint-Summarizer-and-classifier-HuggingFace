        "I was charged a $30 overdraft fee on my account despite having enough funds. It took me three calls to customer service to get the fee reversed. This is a common issue with this bank, and the process is unnecessarily difficult.",
        "My credit card was used for fraudulent purchases totaling over $500. I reported the activity immediately, but the bank's fraud department was slow to respond. I had to wait weeks for a replacement card.",
        "I tried to send a money transfer to a friend, but the transaction failed. The app gave a vague error message. Customer support was not helpful and could not provide a reason for the failure. The funds were held for several days before being returned.",

"I recently discovered that my credit card had been used for several fraudulent purchases, adding up to more than $500. As soon as I noticed the charges, I contacted the bank and reported the issue right away, expecting that it would be handled quickly. Unfortunately, the fraud department took a long time to get back to me, and during that period I felt very anxious and uncertain about my accountâ€™s security. To make matters worse, it took weeks before I finally received a replacement card, which left me unable to make essential purchases and caused a lot of inconvenience in my daily life."
