"user: Do you have a plan to notify passengers well in advance of pilot related cancellations or just wait til the day before? Will you protect passengers on other airlines if flights are cancelled b/c of pilot shortages?
agent: We're planning to fly as scheduled, Shaun.
user: HOW ABOUT ANSWERING MY QUESTION. I'm asking if you do not get enough pilots to fly, which is a possibility, do you have a contingency plan in place on how to get customers to their destinations &amp; when will it be relayed to customers. THE DAY BEFORE WILL NOT BE ACCEPTABLE!
agent: Our team is working hard to avoid cancellations and you'll be notified if otherwise.
user: Your reading comprehension is terrible. WHEN WILL WE BE NOTIFIED? 3 hours b4 our flight so all other flights r sold out? Instead of Doug Parker making comments like ""I don't think we're ever going to lose money again,"" he should b assuring customers we're getting home 4 XMAS
agent: As of now, flights are scheduled and we expect to avoid cancellations.
user: This is like a Seinfeld skit. I know you have flights scheduled. But what about the pilots...are they scheduled? The answer to that ?? in many cases is probably NO. I know the AA twitter team is saying what the company tells u to say, but AA SUCKS at communication.
agent: We‚Äôre working to address this issue. We do expect to avoid cancellations this holiday season.

### Input:
user: Why is my brand new 13 inch MBP draining 50% battery overnight while its supposed to be sleeping? Never had this problem with a Mac. Just got it a few days ago. Is this a High Sierra issue?? ?
agent: We know how important battery life is so we'll do all we can to get to the bottom of what's going on there. Which version of High Sierra are you currently running? Also, are you using the original charging cables that came with your MacBook Pro?
user: 10.13.1 , and yeah I'm using original cable. Dropped 20% in battery last night again without doing anything.
agent: Thanks for verifying. Was your MacBook very recently updated? Is it set to back up automatically using Time Machine? We'd like to share this guide that has information about Power Nap, a feature that can update data while your Mac sleeps:
user: I don't do Time Machine, didn't enable updates(no power nap) and I got the machine 5 days ago so would hope all the updates aren't still draining it
agent: To confirm, it sounds like your MacBook was set up as new, and no data was restored from a backup, correct? Do you recall having enabled FileVault during the initial setup? Have you had a chance to restart your Mac since noticing this behavior while sleeping?
user: Set up as new, enabled Filevault at Setup, I've restarted since setting up. I left it at 100% at 8 AM, this morning, came back to it at 11PM at 46%.
agent: Thanks for the detailed information. We're committed to helping sort this out, so please send us a DM to continue from here.

I either want access to %localappdata% or I want this bug to be fixed (this century, preferably). Closest I can get is to this nonsense here - option greyed out and no apparent way of changing that. Bet there's no code behind that button!
agent: Let's fix this. We suggest that you check the app updates. From app list, go to Microsoft Store &gt; Menu &gt; Downloads and updates &gt; Get updates. Refer to this link for more info:
user: Done this. Moved files to a different path on SD card, *some* has been added. A number of albums, however, haven't been added to my library. I know this isn't a support issue directly, it's just a badly written app but Feedback have been ignoring me from the start.

He processed my refund, found my item to collect and even took away the extra packaging. Very helpful ‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è
agent: We've fed this back to our Store Manager, Gemma. We're glad you have your parcel now but really sorry this wasn't sorted yesterday for you. 1/2 We've also been in touch with our Harrogate Store Manager to let them know what you've said about Jerome. We'll make sure this gets back to him and he gets some well deserved recognition :) Thanks. 2/2

### Response:
Customer arrived fifteen minutes early to pick up a package and was told it was unknown when the package would be ready for pick up. Agent asked which store gave the poor service and did the customer ever receive his package."

### Input:
user: my Xbox one stays on the initial green loading screen, stuff still moves like the light in the X but when it goes to a black screen (after 5 minutes or longer or shorter) nothing works but there's the initial sound it makes when it goes to the home screen. Plz help! !
agent: Hi there! Let's try a fresh start by unplugging the console and your router/modem for a full 5 minutes.
user: It didn't work, it is still taking forever just to get to a black screen, the green loading screen animation works, idk what to do.
agent: Let's take that a step further and unplug the console and your router/modem for a full 5 minutes.
user: It didn't even fully apply the OSU1 thing.... it only jumps to 66% and then stays that way........ what do I do? It's been stuck like this for 25 minutes..... I'm losing my patience
agent: Hi there! Please let the update finish it's process, we know this can be frustrating but it is best to let it complete.
user: I've waited 25+ minutes at the same screen........ I've had it for 5 years almost and this is the worst thing it's done, no problems previously..... I'm genuinely worried that my money has gone down the drain with this purchase.... not happy right now, quite frustrated. Please help me I'm so angry right now at this It will jump from 74% done in general to 86% done and not a % more..... it won't make a difference no matter how long I wait, I've turned it off and on multiple times during this and does what I've said earlier, goes from 74% to 86% and stops.... I'm so angry right now. Is there any way I can send this in for repairs? The original Xbox one??? ?
agent: Yes, you can check out your repair and warranty options here:

agent: We're not showing any seat changes. Please work with our airport team directly as the seat map is under their control at this time.
user: We were supposed to be 17K and L. I verified this last night on the phone with an agent. They moved him to 27J. Those seats are not comparable I‚Äôm particularly angry because last night, when I called and specifically asked if it had changed, they assured me we were booked in those seats. So today it was too late to get two seats together. If they had been honest last night, I could have gotten comparable seats together
agent: Deanna, we're seeing the same seats in the reservation. The change must have been made at the airport. Please work with them directly.
user: Again, it was not. I know that because I‚Äôm siting in a different seat It‚Äôs your flight. Not the airport‚Äôs flight. I feel we should be refunded the upgrade fee

agent: Hi, how can we help you? were you able to recover your settings from the previous app version before the update? Let us know if you need assistance.
user: After updating I can no longer use my pressure sensitive drawing pen on Illustrator. Every other application works fine. Every time I update adobe software something is drastically changed. Don't even get me started on Dreamweaver, one of the worst html editors ever.
agent: Let me loop in an expert to review &amp; respond shortly, please excuse the delay if any. Thanks!
user: Basic things like selecting anchor points are so difficult in Illustrator as well. This thread covers my feelings on this.
agent: Thanks! We've passed this info on to our expert- they will review and get back to you ASAP.  Hi, Sorry to hear that you are facing issues with CC 2018 version of AI. Since you've multiple queries, let me try to answer them one by one. Old settings can be imported while installing the newer version (screenshot). Let's try to check the Illustrator first and then I'll loop in a DW expert as well.

agent: You're welcome. We're happy to hear that our agent was able to help. *TJH
user: WHAT!? Read the convo history. D staff, great to work with &amp; I think they tried 2 help, but my problem wasnt solved &amp; was caused by Delta. I would have been able to celebrate my father's 70th w him, if Delta had any forward thinking and didnt try to meet inflated departure KPIs. A day spent at the Detroit airport in tears &amp; depression isnt how flying should B. Happy Birthday dad, Im sorry I couldnt spend it with you

"user: So obvious why a #failing, T5 completely DEAD, more staff then passengers, terrible customer service, &amp; still can't get on my plane even though it was not due to leave for 50min.
agent: Hi Thamin, if you arrived after check-in for your flight had closed we wouldn't be able to accept you for the flight. Even if the airport is quiet, check in times still need to be met.
user: Natalie I was 5min late. Plane wasn't expected to leave for 55min, airport was empty, pretty sure security would be too, (would guess the plane was too)I'm confident I could have made it to the gate with ample time, with just a tiny bit of your help.
agent: Hi Thamin, I'm afraid this isn't something we can offer any flexibility with. It's not possible to check in for a flight after check in closes, as the system doesn't allow it. Late arrivals can cause flight delays and we apply the same policy to everyone, not just when it's 1/2 busy. I can understand your disappointment, but it's your responsibility to arrive at the airport in good time and complete check in before it closes.  S. 2/2
user: Just for clarification ü§î- so you never allow anyone and have allowed in the past people that are late for checkin? Could you kindly direct me to this policy too please. And are you sure Beth that the system does not allow you to do late check-ins?
agent: We're sorry, Thamim. If you follow this link, it does advise you Click check in essentials. It is your responsibility to arrive at the airport with enough time.
user: You've not answered all my questions - I take my responsibility for being 5min late, but your staff could have easily (assessed it's not busy and) check me in.
agent: We appreciate the points you've raised, Thamim. However, once check in has been closed, we're unable to reopen a passenger list. We hope you understand we have to be fair and consistent with all of our passengers. 1/2 This means our staff wouldn't have been able to make an exception when you travelled. We hope this message helps to clarify our position. 2/2
user: Thank you for the response- but it doesn't suffice and is unacceptable, you're flights are always delayed and customers get no compensation. You also make different exceptions for different people it seems
agent: EU compensation depends on the reason for a delay or cancellation, Thamim. Not all flights are eligible as not all reasons are under our control. We're sorry you remain disappointed, however, as previously advised it's your responsibility to make sure you arrive at the 1/2 airport and check in, in time for your flight. We're unable to hold a flight for a passenger if they are late. Our position remains unchanged.  2/2
user: Natalie - do me favour, let's quantify this: how long on average it takes to get from checkin desk to the furthest boarding gates at T5? And for the record I wasn't asking you to hold a flight, the plane wasn't due to leave for 50min (and it was still delayed by 20min)
agent: Hi Thamin. It can depend on a lot of factors. We appreciate you may not have been asking to hold the flight. If you're late to check in, there isn't any way for you to make the flight, even if the flight is delayed. We're sorry you remain disappointed with our response.

"user: How do I set my Macbook Pro's resolution to 1280x720 without attaching a 2nd monitor? 13"" Mid 2014 with Sierra
agent: Try setting that by following this article: Let us know if this helps.
user: I have read a couple of these kinds of articles, but I want this to work without having to attach a second monitor. I just want to set the resolution and then record my screen. And then upload to Youtube.
agent: Check these steps out from the article: Set the resolution for the primary display: Choose Apple menu &gt; System Preferences, click Displays, then click Display. Pick Scaled, then select one of the options. After Scaled, you should see the resolution you want.
user: In Scaled I can set the following resolutions: 1024x640, 1280x800, 1440x900, 1680x1050.
agent: We missed that you were looking for 1280 x 720. We can get you to that resolution. Press and hold the Option key on your keyboard while you click on the Scaled option in the Display Setting. This will open up other options for you. Click 1280 x 720 here.
user: That button does nothing when I click it. It's just a dummy button. All those hidden options and buttons work when a second monitor is attached, but I don't always have access to an extra monitor. And also: that's just clumsy. In Windows this is no problem BTW.
agent: Pressing the button on its own will not do anything. However, if you press and hold Option and then click the little bubble to the immediate left of the word ""Scaled"", you should see the other options appear.
user: It won't show other options. It will only show the 4 standard options. And this ""Recognize Monitors"" button doesn't do anything either.
agent: Okay. Let's move to DM and we can continue there.

user: So it‚Äôs been over 24 hours. Still no delivery estimate and no progress. What is going on with this shipment? Package was released over 48 hours ago. Still hasn‚Äôt moved. Delivery was scheduled for today, 11/21.
agent: The package has been cleared, but has not resumed transit. Once it does, we will be able to have the package sent to the destination facility for delivery to you. We understand the importance of your package and appreciate your patience.
user: But my question is WHY hasn‚Äôt it resumed transit. No one has been able to answer this question for two days. Not helpful at all.
agent: There is an Iphone hold up currently. If you do not want to wait I would advise contacting the shipper to see if there is another way you can possibly get it.
user: This is response I got from chat: I do not know why they referred you to us when they have your package and have access to whats going on with it. All of the shipping information that we provided to customers comes from UPS so they should have helped you with that.
agent: Our records indicate the package is in the process of being released by customs. We have no control on how long this can take, however, the package delivery date will be updated once the package is released. Please continue to track at
user: Your tracking page says ‚ÄúClearance completed.‚Äù It has since 11/19, 2 days ago. What is the discrepancy in your system?
agent: The package was released on Sunday, 11/19/17, however, the package can move without being scanned. The package still needs to reach the destination. Typically the scheduled delivery date would be today, 11/21, however, it has been delayed due to customs.
user: Man, you guys keep telling me different things. Now the package can move without being scanned? What a joke. An absolute joke. I didn‚Äôt think there was a way for UPS to screw up my delivery any more ways, but you have proven me wrong.
agent: I show that this package has been requested to be held for pickup. Please DM us if anything further is needed.

user: Yea it only happens in the iTunes app, and I‚Äôm able to sign in with 0 problems

The customer wants to buy music but he is unable to do and he says that if he search up a song, click 'buy', type in password and then it makes him do it several times. The agent asks whether that happens only in the iTunes Store app, whether the customer is able to sign into their Apple ID website without any issues and asks to DM the result after trying to restart the device."

"user: how long is it before you contact someone who's taken my bag by mistake. I've got a lost luggage ref number. Got told today that a similar bag got left so that's who probably has mine. I've got the majority of my clothes in it and want them back asap.
agent: We're sorry, Dan. If we delivered your bag to the carousel and someone else picked it up we're not responsible for contacting them on your behalf. However, if there's been a bag left behind we'll do all we can to get in touch with that customer for them to retrieve it.
user: When I spoke to BA on the phone earlier they said there had been a bag left behind that is similar. They said you can't return theirs until mine has been returned. It's a bit annoying that you can't contact them and enquire if they have mine by mistake. What are my options?
agent: Hi Dan, I can appreciate your frustration. Unfortunately, we're unable to do anything until your bag has been returned, as you already know. You could contact the police and report your bag as stolen, or file a lost bag claim with your travel insurance company.
user: So people can just get off your flights and take whatever baggage they want? great that is!! You literally have to ring up one person and you won't, I'll not be using BA again in a hurry!
agent: Hi Dan. As soon as the passenger who has collected your bag gets back in touch with us, we'll have more information. I'm sorry we're unable to assist further.
user: Thanks Kev how long do I need to leave it before putting a claim in with you or the insurance?
agent: Hi Dan. If another passenger has your bag, you wouldn't be able to make a claim with us. You may be able to claim through your insurance so you may want to contact them.
user: So is there absolutely no possibility that you can contact the person who's bag was left and ask. Obviously I would but you wouldn't be able to give me their details. I've got presents etc in the bag and no money to replace them now, so it's essentially ruined my Christmas.

user: Yes. Krishna K. got it fixed. But not without some struggles. As a weekly rental property, this can't be an ongoing problem and there has to be an easy way for them to solve it.
agent: I'm glad to hear Krishna was able to get the matter taken care of you. Was she a business class representative?  .
user: No idea. She did not appear to understand the bulk agreement, but was eventually able to locate the account and communicate with my DTA. She wasn't able to give me detailed information on what she did. Just said it wouldn't happen again. I have to say I am skeptical based on history. This is a rental unit &amp; guests won't troubleshoot, they'll just bypass the DTA. Not a good thing.
agent: I understand. I'm hopeful you wouldn't experience issues again. However, if you do, I would certainly recommend speaking with our business class department as I'm sure they will have a quick &amp; full access to your account. Do you have contact information...
user: Is it available 24/7? Would a guest be able to call? What info would they have to give?
agent: That would depend on their reason for calling. If they're having service related issues they may not need to provide much account details. However, this would be at the discretion of the representative they speak with. The contact telephone number is 866.243.9787.  .
user: Is it 24/7? You do understand that discretion of the representative is not what a renter who has paid good money to enjoy vacation wants to hear. Easy to do business with, is best.

"user: I was wanting to look into possibly upgrading my seat (GINX36) but the seating chart says 1st class and delta comfort are all gone. That's impossible.
agent: Hi Freddie, thanks for contacting us. My apologies for the inconvenience. One moment while I look into this further. *HML Thanks for your patience. I'm showing First Class is sold out for your flights; however, Delta Comfort + is available. The Delta Comfort + cabin is sold as a fare for this market; therefore, in order to confirm Comfort + there will be a difference in the fare. *HML
user: What does this upgrade list mean? And this one for the first leg of the flight?
agent: It looks like there may an error between our system and the app. I'm checking into this now. *HML
user: ive heard about airlines blocking out seats for the purpose of overbooking and juggling to squeeze profits. I didnt know you guys were still doing that or doing it period
agent: Thanks for your patience. I am showing seats available in First Class; however, the lower First Class fares are not available. Once your reservation is changed to the First Class cabin, you will be able to view and assign seats. *HML You may see more availability closer to the time of travel. *HML
user: This explanation sounds very convoluted. 1st there was no seats available, now there are seats, but there are no more lower 1st class fares available? What's does that mean and how do I upgrade seats. That's the whole reason I tweeted you. Cmon Delta aka *HML
agent: Freddie, in order upgrade your ticket to First Class, you must pay the difference in the fare. In reviewing your ticket, you have no value left to apply towards the cost of the ticket to upgrade. *HML If you're using miles to upgrade, the cost is 35,000 miles each way and you must be booked in a L, U, or T class fare. *HML
user: What do mean I must pay the difference but then say I have no value left in my ticket? Why not just tell me how much it is to upgrade like I've been asking from the beginning? What does it mean I have no value in a tix I purchased?
agent: To make changes to your reservation there is a change fee of $200.00. Your ticket is less than the change fee; therefore, there is no value in your ticket. I can provide an estimated cost to change your ticket; however, this does not include taxes and fees. *HML The estimated cost is $1,500.00 for First Class on your flight from EWR to GCM. This does not include taxes and airport fees and fares are not guaranteed until purchased. Please contact our International Reservation specialist at 1-800-241-4141. *HML

user: I was wanting to look into possibly upgrading my seat (GINX36) but the seating chart says 1st class and delta comfort are all gone. That's impossible.
agent: Hi Freddie, thanks for contacting us. My apologies for the inconvenience. One moment while I look into this further. *HML Thanks for your patience. I'm showing First Class is sold out for your flights; however, Delta Comfort + is available. The Delta Comfort + cabin is sold as a fare for this market; therefore, in order to confirm Comfort + there will be a difference in the fare. *HML
user: What does this upgrade list mean? And this one for the first leg of the flight?
agent: It looks like there may an error between our system and the app. I'm checking into this now. *HML
user: ive heard about airlines blocking out seats for the purpose of overbooking and juggling to squeeze profits. I didnt know you guys were still doing that or doing it period
agent: Thanks for your patience. I am showing seats available in First Class; however, the lower First Class fares are not available. Once your reservation is changed to the First Class cabin, you will be able to view and assign seats. *HML You may see more availability closer to the time of travel. *HML
user: This explanation sounds very convoluted. 1st there was no seats available, now there are seats, but there are no more lower 1st class fares available? What's does that mean and how do I upgrade seats. That's the whole reason I tweeted you. Cmon Delta aka *HML
agent: Freddie, in order upgrade your ticket to First Class, you must pay the difference in the fare. In reviewing your ticket, you have no value left to apply towards the cost of the ticket to upgrade. *HML If you're using miles to upgrade, the cost is 35,000 miles each way and you must be booked in a L, U, or T class fare. *HML
user: What do mean I must pay the difference but then say I have no value left in my ticket? Why not just tell me how much it is to upgrade like I've been asking from the beginning? What does it mean I have no value in a tix I purchased?
agent: To make changes to your reservation there is a change fee of $200.00. Your ticket is less than the change fee; therefore, there is no value in your ticket. I can provide an estimated cost to change your ticket; however, this does not include taxes and fees. *HML The estimated cost is $1,500.00 for First Class on your flight from EWR to GCM. This does not include taxes and airport fees and fares are not guaranteed until purchased. Please contact our International Reservation specialist at 1-800-241-4141. *HML

### Response:
Customer is complaining about the inconvenience of unavailable first class seats and asking is there no value of purchased tix. Agent informed that customer has no value remain to apply for first class and further informed about the service charges amount and said that comfort+ seats are available."

user: No I didn't the person on live chat offered one but then insinuated I was stupid and encouraged me not to order again his supervisor was even worse.

Forgive me for being sceptical but why would I do that ?

agent: Hi, I understand you were sent the wrong item twice. We would have to look into this more closely, hence why we are unable to replace it. The refund will take 5-7 business days to process. Is the item available from any other sellers? Apologies once again

"user: the 2120 Salisbury train from Waterloo. Not really getting much info guys.... So it was incorrectly coupled?? Really???? Your driver decoupled and recoupled it and the doors ""magically worked"". Serious breach in protocol there guys. Playing with safety because previous driver wanted to clock out.
agent: On occasion the electrical contacts that the trains use to pass communications for door controls, power and brake, information systems, etc will not make contact properly. In these cases, detaching and reattaching is the approved process taken in line with our fleet 1/3 team's fault-finding instructions, and done under the instruction of maintenance staff and the fleet control manager. The train's fail-safe systems would not allow it to move in this situation, and if we could not resolve the problem, the train would be taken out of service. 2/3 Safety is, and always will be, our first priority, and in this case protocols were followed correctly. Our fleet team will investigate using on-board monitoring systems as to what when wrong in this case and take appropriate action.  3/3
user: So wait a second. Once a driver couples the train it's not protocol to test immediately, but to wait until the carriages are full of passengers to then couple? That's your statement?
agent: On more modern stock the train will undertake the necessary tests to confirm. With older trains, there is a ""pull-away"" test to confirm the trains are physically coupled together, but it is not always immediately apparent that the all of the 100+ contacts on the train 1/3 type in question are making suitable contact. Any one of these pins not making proper contact can result in the train not being able to move as part of fail-safe systems built in. As mentioned, more modern trains such as our 450 and 444 types have computer systems on board 2/3 which test each signal passing through the contacts to confirm that the train is attached both physically and electronically.  3/3
user: Whilst I'm still shocked, I appreciate the fullness of the answer! :)
agent: No worries - I'm ex train-crew, so this is rather my specialist topic! Appreciate that it seems a little antiquated, but it's all vetted and okayed by the safety bodies. It's similar to the modern trains, where resolving problems can often come down to turning off the 1/2 train's management systems and turning them back on again!  2/2
user: Ahh that makes sense, thought the response was a little more detailed than usual. As a regular passenger I like understanding more, helps me to work around problems and know when to make alternative plans. It's amazing how often turning it off and on again actually works
agent: I always try to give something a bit more detailed, running a railway often has a lot more to it than it appears (I was recently conversing with about emissions standards, which was an interesting research topic). Benefits of 6 years experience though!

The laptop they sent (cont) (Cont) lacked those features. I tried contacting the seller, they didn't reply. I submitted a claim, they finally replied saying they would give me a refund after they sent this laptop back, which is no bueno. I'm currently a student taking online classes and I need (cont) (Cont) a computer of some kind, so going through all the steps of sending the laptop back, waiting for my refund to be available, and then ording a new laptop and waiting for it get here will take too much time. I just want them to send the right computer I ordered. (Cont) I think I can mange sending them this one back first and waiting for the correct one. If you can help getting me the laptop I ordered, that would be amazing.

user: So Amazon.. it happened again. Driver saw gate, didn't try to deliver. We were home. Now my wife is spending an hour with your chat server AGAIN, and we'll have to wait all day AGAIN for another delivery attempt. Your homebrew delivery service really makes me want to order from someone else in the future. Such headaches compared to how your service worked in the past. So difficult to get a delivery now. Used to be so simple.. order everyday stuff, get home and it was on our doorstep, now it's easier to go to the store than order from you. Don't think that's what you intended.
agent: I'd like to have a member of our team investigate further into this matter with you. Will you please send us your details at your nearest convenience:

user: Your Amazon Prime membership isn't worth it if your cut rate delivery service can't deliver the packages on time or correctly
agent: I am so sorry about your orders! Have you recently had a delivery late or delivered incorrectly? We want to help in any way possible!
user: So a whole day lost... and now we have a second package coming tomorrow, which might have the same problem. Can't go anywhere if your service is doing the delivery. Wouldn't be a problem with USPS, UPS, or Fedex.
agent: We'd like to look into this further. Please pass your order details to us here:
user: Info sent. Hopefully there's a solution for gated communities that doesn't require staying home all day waiting.
agent: I can confirm that we have received your information! We will review your information as soon as possible!
user: So Amazon.. it happened again. Driver saw gate, didn't try to deliver. We were home. Now my wife is spending an hour with your chat server AGAIN, and we'll have to wait all day AGAIN for another delivery attempt. Your homebrew delivery service really makes me want to order from someone else in the future. Such headaches compared to how your service worked in the past. So difficult to get a delivery now. Used to be so simple.. order everyday stuff, get home and it was on our doorstep, now it's easier to go to the store than order from you. Don't think that's what you intended.
agent: I'd like to have a member of our team investigate further into this matter with you. Will you please send us your details at your nearest convenience:
user: I did that last time, no one contacted me, but I'll send the info again. Considering cancelling my Prime service since I can't get deliveries.
agent: We've received your information, we will reach out once we've had a chance to investigate. Thank you for your patience.

user: Yes, been lied to over and over again by #Virgin staff over unused train tickets and refund. #Disgraceful
agent: Can you please explain further?
user: Yes (AGAIN!) Was told not to travel due to WC ML disruption and I would receive a full refund, sent tix - no refund. Wrote &amp; complained - nothing, spoke online, was told to I would be contacted in 48-72 hours, again nothing!
agent: Did you apply through your point of purchase because that is who should issue the refund.
user: Well the point of purchase was Virgin Trains website! Followed the procedures told by your call centre (India) to send the tickets to VT (in Edinburgh) to receive refund. Then just ignored!
agent: Can you please DM us with your booking reference and we'll have a look.
user: Sorry, I'm keeping this public. I DM this last time and all I was told to do was go on the website and speak on the live chat on there. Wasted time on there explaining it AGAIN and was told I'd be recontacted - nothing!
agent: I'm afraid we'd need to ask you some security questions for data protection so we can't do that publicly.
user: Okay, fair enough, but I would assume you'll just do exactly the same as your colleagues did last week! *sigh* Wow, your call centre is really good! 03445565650 ""Can't help you at all, phone another number"" Passed round from pillar to post here!
agent: I'm afraid you will have needed to check within a reasonable amount of time, it is now nearly 2 years since the journey date so nothing can be done for it I'm afraid.
user: You are REALLY taking the mickey now! I did as I was asked, and not refunded! Disgusting way to treat your customers!
agent: I'm afraid there isn't anything we can do I'm afraid as the tickets were not tracked there is no way to find them and a refund is not due.
user: Even though I have a copy of the (unused) tickets? I know Virgin like to rip people off by claiming non-receipt therefore I kept hold of a copy of them. Let me find them.
agent: I'm afraid so, a copy won't suffice.

### Input:
user: And all I need is my music to keep me from going crazy and Spotify won‚Äôt load or play more than a few songs before crashing through their website player. Looking straight at you üëÄ I need my music or else I may have a mental breakdown
agent: Hey Katey! Does clearing your cache/cookies help? You might also want to try using an incognito window. Let us know how it goes üôÇ /KL
user: Well it‚Äôs a work computer so I don‚Äôt have a lot of permissions, but heard from a friend I was not the only one.
agent: Got it. Can you let us know what web browser you're using? We'll be right here waiting /KL
user: I use chrome.
agent: Are you able to try a different web browser? Also, do you have any antivirus/firewall programs activated? Keep us posted /KL
user: Just have chrome. And theres tons of security on this computer since it‚Äôs a work one. Seems to be more stable now
agent: Got it! Glad to hear it's more stable. If you ever need anything else, just shout and we'll come running üèÉ /KL
user: Well it‚Äôs happening AGAIN today. Clear cache/cookies and it continues to crash in chrome.
agent: Can you try using an incognito window? Could you also ask your work IT if they've put up some restrictions that might block Spotify? /JP
user: It‚Äôs so random, hadn‚Äôt done it ever before when I first contacted you guys. And now it has randomly resolved itself again. I‚Äôll try incognito next time it does it, but I know someone that this happened to in another country the other day.
agent: Sounds like a plan. We'll keep an eye out for any updates /JP

agent: Hi, Alexander. Let's work on this. Which version of Windows do you have? Have you made any recent changes prior to the issue? Can you also send a short video clip of the actual issue?
user: Win10 x64 Cumulative update v1709 for amd64 systems KB4048955, Adobe Flash update KB4048951 and Visual C++ update KB2467173. Not aware of recent changes and a video would just show me clicking on a Start button doing nothing. Build 16299.64 Only thing I did see and might have something to do with this (or not) is a white stripe of 1 pixel on the sides of for instance firefox on full screen and sometimes vlc player disappears in the upper left corner instead of going full screen. Can't reproduce that at the moment Clicking on restart does not solve the problem. I really have to freshly restart the computer when this happens in order to get the Start button functioning again. That makes it annoying when after a restart it turns out that it did not really restart. Now it's working of course
