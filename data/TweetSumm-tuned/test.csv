"user: Current version of your Hulu app for Amazon FireTV has sound that is half a second or more delayed from video, even after cache clearing and other troubleshooting. Please tell me it's being fixed soon. It's been weeks now.
agent: Apologies, Mark! Let's confirm we've gone through:
user: Did the cache clearing, and will try uninstall reinstall this evening.
agent: Sounds like a plan! Thanks again for being willing to troubleshoot with us. We'll be on standby for the results.
user: I tried uninstall/reinstall, so I have been through all the troubleshooting steps. Problem seemed worse actually. There is a hulu uservoice where others are reporting this as well on Fire TV. I suspect it needs a bug fix. See this: A month of my subscription fee has now been wasted trying to watch video with this audio delay on your Fire TV app. I'm going to deactivate I think and wait for a version update.
agent: Sorry for the continued trouble, Mark, as we'd hate to see you go! Have you tried connecting your Fire TV to a different HDMI port for comparison? If no change after, please call/chat us so we can take a closer look on our end:
user: My monitor has only one port. Hulu is the only app with an audio delay, and only since the update to this new look a few weeks back. I also use netflix, crackle, and amazon video with no audio delay. Monitor is reliable 4K monitor and all video I watch is through FireTV apps. I put my Hulu account on hold. Unless Hulu decides to pay ME to help solve a problem with the hulu FireTV app, I won't spend hrs on the line trying same ineffective troubleshooting I've already done. If you want more information about my specific setup (FireTV model/version, monitor, things like that... ), and these will be used in-house by QE team to troubleshoot, I could send that. Here's information you can pass along. Previously, delayed sound occurred with and without bluetooth speaker use. App JUST got a new update on FireTV. Now, audio of HDMI seems ok, but bluetooth audio is delayed. ONLY with the hulu app.
agent: We're glad to hear about the improvement, Mark. We do not support any external audio devices at this stage, which may be why you're having trouble with bluetooth. We'll definitely pass along the interest, though. Let us know if we can assist further.

user: Is there a specific time?
agent: Unfortunately not, however stock is usually put out on the shelves a day after delivery. To find out for sure on the day you plan to travel, it would be best to give them a call in advance (01723 500693). Hope this helps! Ewan

agent: Thanks for confirming. Our system is showing that they're due a delivery on the 18th November. I'd advise calling ahead to avoid an unnecessary journey, their number is 01723 500693...1/2 ...Using the link, if you DM your postcode I'll check the stock in the other stores in your area. Dan 2/2
user: Is there a specific time?
agent: Unfortunately not, however stock is usually put out on the shelves a day after delivery. To find out for sure on the day you plan to travel, it would be best to give them a call in advance (01723 500693). Hope this helps! Ewan
user: Hypothetically if you were to ring and ask them to hold a copy of both back when they receive this delivery, would they agree to do so to ensure they don't sell out of either game before you get there?
agent: As it will still be in our Double Up promotional period, they wouldn't be able to hold any stock for customers. Sorry to disappoint. Ewan
user: Thanks for the reply. That's disappointing.
agent: You're welcome Sean. Ewan

### Response:
Customer having disappointment double up points and stocks at sainsburys. Agent has taken the post code details from the customer to ensure of on timing delivery."

agent: Hey, could you direct message us and explain in detail what issue you are experiencing?
user: Preordered the xb1x Scorpio ed. And everything works fine except the controller, which freezes. Light still on, no button press reaction and os said controller is disconnected. Happens only with the batteries inside though. When I take them out and use cable it works (1/2) I called the German MS Support about it and they told me to go back to amazon, since it’s their issue not MS. Amazon offers me to send it back and give me a refund but all I want is my Scorpio controller working. Why is that so hard?
agent: We understand the frustration with that, but if the controller has an internal issue you would need to follow the return policy for the retailer to get a new one. Have you been able to test brand new batteries with the controller by chance?
user: Yep. With different other batteries - same issue. Amazon only offers to refund the whole bundle. But then I’ll lose the Scorpio edition - that is what frustrates me. Why can’t you just give me a funtioning one or repair mine?! I can’t believe that this ain’t possible
agent: Have you reached out to them to see if they can provide the Scorpio edition? Just to be 1  sure, let's have you reach out to our chat team here: to try and ensure that happens. 2
user: yea...maybe you go ahead and try the website yourself. Especially, when you click on Controllers and nothing happens. Then tried other topic and open chat but nothing happens. Really REALLY frustrating experience with the support until now. Unbelievable

user: Sorry, I don't understand. All I can see is what is pictured in the screenshot from the previous tweet.
agent: Hmm. Let's go back to Microsoft Word app. On the right side, click on Version History. Scroll down to see the changes log.
user: I can see version numbers, but not actual changes. The last time that actual changes were documented was 1.28 on the 12th of Dec 2016.
agent: Got this. Just to clarify, what are the extension of the files that you've opened? Are they on .pdf format?
user: Why is the file format relevant? I'm in the App Store. I normally open .docx files
agent: 1/2 Thanks for providing this info. Your concern requires in-depth support. Let's have our Answer Desk team check it out. 2/2 Here's the link where you can reach them: We’d love to hear back from you about your experience with us! Please let us know here:

agent: Hi, Katharine, I'm sorry to hear we disappointed you. There are fees involved to transfer miles from one account to another. *TRR
user: So there's nothing you can do to help my friend out? The only reason I didn't have enough miles in my account was cuz I already booked addtl trips w/ delta!

agent: What he could have done, instead of transferring the miles, was purchase the ticket for you using his miles. No need to transfer. *TMS

### Input:
user: really? My friend was just helping me out w/ a few xtra skymiles, &amp; you charged HIM a $130 transfer fee? He's not even traveling. He's just doing me a favor... c'mon! #HelpAFriendOut
agent: Hi, Katharine, I'm sorry to hear we disappointed you. There are fees involved to transfer miles from one account to another. *TRR
user: So there's nothing you can do to help my friend out? The only reason I didn't have enough miles in my account was cuz I already booked addtl trips w/ delta!
agent: We cannot transfer miles here in reservations. It can only be done online. *TMS
user: So where do I go online to help my friend get reimbursed?
agent: I'm sorry, reimbursed for what? Transfer of miles is done here: *TMS
user: For Delta charging my friend for being a good guy &amp; making my dream trip possible! He's not even traveling, &amp; the only reason I didn't have the miles needed was cuz I already booked other trips w/ Delta.
agent: What he could have done, instead of transferring the miles, was purchase the ticket for you using his miles. No need to transfer. *TMS

"user: Hi. Pe-ordered #StarWarsBattlefrontII at your Chichester store as the promo card said would receive #StarWarsTheLastJedi skins... something's gone wrong somewhere? Can you help/advise? #StarWarsBattlefrontII #tesco #dissapointedsonafterschool
agent: Hi Shenman, they should be inside the packaging. Please contact the game creators. They should be able to advise further with it not being inside - Allyn
user: but as pre-order how would retailers know which product to hand out to pre-orders as all look same? can U shed light? can you 'help'?
agent: Hiya, having worked in a store myself, I can tell you that any pre-order games come in a separate delivery to the main stock we will sell. This is to avoid those who made a pre-order not getting the new game as soon as it is released. TY
user: thanks but I checked and they only had one version of the game. No distinction between pre order and regular stock? so if I follow the logic here I was given the wrong copy? If your staff new nothing off the promotion (which they didn't) then they may have been giving out the pre-order copies to people who were just buying the regular game? I'm not trying to be awkward but I would just like what I was sold and what I actually paid in advance for. There must be some way of supplying your customers correctly. I was told by staff in store that if you order via Direct they email the codes. So surely it must be possible for you to supply them to me that way? It would be nice to think Tesco care about resolving things like this for their customers and doing what is fair and correct.
agent: Hi there, I've spoken to my Support Team to confirm, and they've advised that you would need to speak to EA. TY. - Mart

user: Really disappointed with my home delivery tonight. Most of the meat ordered goes out of date in the next 24-48 hours. Will not be using again. How is thisbgood meant to last the week?
agent: Hi Tony, we sell products up to midnight of their expiry date to cut down on food waste. Our drivers are obliged to wait while you...1/2 ...inspect your order. Anything you're not happy with can be rejected for a full refund. Steven 2/2
user: They did not offer this, in fact the driver didn't say 3 words to me. I would have sent it all back. And if I was shopping in store, I wouldn't have picked these items. I thought home delivery was meant to be as fresh as you pick yourself Can you guys do anything about this
agent: Could you DM us the order number and account holder's name with the link below please? We'll look into this. Maclaine
user: I have already sorted this with your telephone team. Couldn't wait 2 days for you guys to respond
agent: Sorry about that Tony, we've been very busy. I'm glad you got everything sorted though! Ewan
