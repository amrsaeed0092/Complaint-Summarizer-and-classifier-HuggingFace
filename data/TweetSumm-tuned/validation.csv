"user: Is it normal for my Xbox One X to be making pretty loud fan noises? Even while the console is off? It seems to be louder than my original One.
agent: Hiya! Just to clarify, does your console have plenty of room for ventilation: Also, is your console plugged directly into a wall outlet?
user: Yes it does have plenty of ventilation, and no it is not directly to the wall outlet. I have it connected to a surge protector.
agent: Thanks for this info, a direct wall outlet connection would be recommended: If you 1  plug the console directly into the wall outlet &amp; test for a bit, do you hear this noise? 2
user: It seems to have stopped that noise, thank you! Also does having it connected to a surge protector mess up the console in any way? Because that noise was worrying me
agent: We could not speculate on this, but a surge protector is not recommended since the power supply has built-in protection.

"user: Hey just tried to by tickets through your app &amp; in the 10 seconds from selecting them to paying they became ""unavailable"". Reset the app &amp; now they've gone up! Really disappointed. Tempted to go with Chiltern. Don't supposed you want to offer them at old price?
agent: Were these Advance tickets? If so they are subject to availability and may have been booked by someone else. Therefore we cannot offer them at the other price.
user: They were advance tickets, yes, but surely you shouldn't make a product available at a price let peope go through the process and then increase the price. Other ticketing sites guarantee the ticket is yours, subject to payment, as soon as you select it
agent: I'm afraid these can be booked by someone up until the booking page
user: I was on the booking page. I'd put my card details in and then it rejected it because you'd sold them to someone else.

agent: Were you travelling with an Advance ticket for your journey?
user: Yes, have no problem with my normal train but this delay will make me: miss my next train from Bham,then add an hour+ to my drive time after
agent: I understand the frustration with the delay. As that service is still in operation you do have to travel as booked
user: Which is bull. What ever happened to compassion? Seems you guys don‚Äôt care once money has changed hands It‚Äôs not as if it was peak time - the train was near empty leaving the station here.
agent: That is the condition of that fare. It is only valid on the booked train. Staff will have followed the correct procedure
user: Well the booked train is not arriving at the time I booked for. So the service I have PAID for does not exist Here‚Äôs ANOTHER route I could have taken Again, an empty train
agent: Advance fares are only valid on the booked service, which is still running
user: Yeah, you keep saying that. Obviously missing my next train means nothing? And it is running 24 mins late currently. You think that is a service worth paying for?
agent: I'm afraid I'm unable to advise further on this as staff have followed the correct protocol in these circumstances

Custoner is complaining about delay of advance fare train booking. Agent has been justifying the customer about the issue saying that staff have followed the correct protocol in the circumstances."

"user: The worst change in MacOS High Sierra is the behavior of the music control buttons on the keyboard. Instead of always working, it only works (sometimes) when the application (iTunes/Spotify) is on the screen. *Coincidentally* it doesn't seem to work for Spotify at all. please tell someone somewhere to bring this back to how it was. I use these buttons all day and now (a) nothing happens or (b) the wrong application is affected.
agent: Let's take a look at what's causing you not to be able to control your iTunes music from your keyboard. To begin, which Mac are you using? Also, is it an external keyboard?
user: I'm using a MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Early 2015). This issue occurs on both an (Apple) external keyboard as well as the built-in one. Sometimes the controls work, but when I have open in Safari it will play its notification sound instead, for example.
agent: Thank you. Next, is it fully updated to macOS High Sierra 10.13.1? What version of iTunes are you using?
user: Both are fully up-to-date. I'm pretty sure this is a 'feature', not a bug, though. As of High Sierra the media keys seem to be binding to the last opened 'controllable' app. It's just that it happens to bind to the wrong apps (like in Safari).
agent: The media keys now control playback for the app you are currently using. If you are using Safari, pressing the play/pause key will attempt to perform this action in Safari. We encourage you to provide feedback concerning this here:

"user: Hello, I bought 2 Tesco's own Xero Colas and was wondering why one of them tasted awful, it was 8 months out of date (APR 2017) so I checked the other bottle, but that one says APR 2018 and is fine.
agent: Hello there, I am sorry you have purchased an out of date bottle of pop, can you please DM your full name, address and email? Can you also send a pic of your full receipt and the barcode on the coke? I can issue a Moneycard refund. 1/2 I will also call the store when they reopen and ask them to check to ensure there are no more on the shelves. Would you prefer to receive an email Moneycard you can use straight away, or one posted which can take up to 10 days? Chris 2/2
user: That's a great idea, and I'm okay for a refund, it was only 50p.
agent: Hey there, I've just called the Park Road Extra store and have spoken with Martin, who is currently the Duty Manager on shift this morning. 1/4 Whilst on the phone to him today, he checked the shelves and confirmed that there are no longer any out of date bottles available on shelves; one must have slipped through the net for which he has apologised for. 2/4 We'd insist on offering you a refund, given the fact that one of the bottles was out of date, this is a mistake on our part, and one you shouldn't have to pay for. 3/4 If you were happy to provide the details requested by Chris, we can get this setup for you and ensure you aren't left out of pocket. Kind Regards - Rob 4/4
user: I have sent you a Direct Message with all the details requested.
agent: Hi Kristo, that's great, thanks very much. I've arranged for a refund and extra for another bottle on us. This will be with you in the next half hour. If there's anything else I can do for you today, let me know! TY - Robyn
